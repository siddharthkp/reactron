## Examples

<AlertExamples.Simple />

```jsx
<Alert>Oh noes!</Alert>
```

### Appearances

There are multiple appearances for `Alert`, dependending on the context.

<AlertExamples.Styles />

```jsx
<Alert appearance="warning">Hey! You should take care of this</Alert>
<Alert appearance="error">Oh no! Something went horribly wrong</Alert>
<Alert appearance="info">By the way, here's some information</Alert>
<Alert appearance="success">Kudos! You did great</Alert>
<Alert appearance="transparent">Sometimes, you have to subtle</Alert>
```

### Dismissible

If you want the user to be able to dismiss the Alert, you can add the `dismissible` prop along with a `onDismiss` method.

<Examples.Dismissible />

```jsx
<Alert onDismiss={props.onDismiss}>Oh noes!</Alert>
```
